To compile: make compile
To run: ./main [input.txt]
To clean: make clean

deleteSub: counting iterations
while (go to lower bound) {
      iterates < n times
}
while (go to upper bound) {
      iterates < n times
}
at worst both while loops added together will not be
larger than n therefore
O(n)

mode: counting comparisons
while (length) {  runs n times
      if () {

      } else if() {

      } +1 comparisons
      if () {

      } +1 comparisons
}
2n is of O(n)

swapAlt: counting assignments
+3
while (length/2) {
      swapNodes(); +6
      +2
      if () {
      +2
      }
}
5n+3 is of O(n)
